# LKS-Dataset

This is the official repo for the Liver Kidney Stomach dataset introduced in the paper: [SOS: Selective Objective Switch for Rapid Immunofluorescence Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.05080). After presenting the associated paper at CVPR2020, this repo will be updated to contain a detailed explanation of the dataset and how to recreate the experiments in our paper. In the meantime, early access to the dataset is available [here](https://rdm.uq.edu.au/files/542dc8a0-7ed2-11ea-9b07-87e97005c7b7).
