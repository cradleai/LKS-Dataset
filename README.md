# LKS-Dataset

This is the official repo for the Liver Kidney Stomach dataset introduced in the paper: "SOS: Selective Objective Switch for Rapid Immunofluorescence Whole Slide Image Classification". After presenting the associated paper at CVPR2020, this repo will be updated to contain a detailed explanation of the dataset and how to recreate the experiments in our paper. In the meantime, early access to the dataset is available [here] (https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:a6bf65d). Please cite the following paper when using this data for your research:
